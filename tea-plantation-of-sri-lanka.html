            <p>The changes in climatic and geographical factors affect the chemical composition of the tea
                leaves. As the agro-climatic conditions vary, the texture, aroma, and taste of the tea change in
                addition. In fact, high-grown tea has paler tones and mellow flavors whereas low-grown tea has
                darker tones and astringent flavors.
                Moreover, Sri Lanka has seven main tea districts that come under the above three major
                tea-growing regions. They are as follows.</p>
            <img src="images/Picture10.webp" class="pl-sideimage">

            <ol>
                <li>Nuwara Eliya</li>
                <li>Dimbula</li>
                <li>Kandy</li>
                <li>Uda Pussellewa</li>
                <li>Uva</li>
                <li>Sabaragamuwa</li>
                <li>Ruhuna</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Out of these, Sabaragamuwa and Ruhuna produce low-grown tea, Kandy produces mid-grown tea while
                Uva, Nuwara Eliya, Dimbula, and Uda Pussellewa produce high-grown tea.
                The seven tea districts produce tea with taste, texture, and aroma endemic to the region.
                Besides, the use of the name of the region on the tea brands follows a tight set of guidelines.
                Therefore, tea that is grown, plucked, processed, manufactured, and packed within the region is
                only allowed to use the name of the region. The effect of diverse climatic, geographical
                conditions, and microclimatic conditions inside a region results in a range of characteristics
                in Ceylon tea.
                However, the following sections will provide you a brief description of the tea plantations in
                each of these tea-growing regions.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Kandy Tea District</h2>
            <p>The hill capital of Sri Lanka where the maiden commercial tea cultivation was embarked upon,
                belongs to the mid-grown regions where tea is cultivated on slopes ranging from 600m to 1200m.
                They are simply “intensely full-bodied” tea with the right amounts of aroma and flavor. Further,
                Kandyan tea has a bright infusion with coppery tones. Tea plantations are visible on the borders
                of the district, in Nilambe, Hanthana, Gampola, and Hewaheta. Besides, the Kandyan tea district
                receives its rainfall from southwestern Monsoons. Accordingly, Kandy owns 71,108 Ha of land with
                lush tea cultivation which is about 32% of the total tea plantations in Sri Lanka.</p>

            <h2>Hanthana Estate</h2>
            <p>Hanthana estate which is 4km away from Kandy was one of the first successful estates to grow tea.
                The Ceylon Tea Board controls the estate and the estate's tea factory has been converted to the
                Ceylon tea museum. The museum is a showcase of the journey of Ceylon tea with its two floors
                occupied with ancient machinery used in processing tea.
                In addition to the Hanthana estate, the Kadugannawa tea estate, located on the way to Kandy from
                Colombo, Kataboola estate which is one of the most picturesque estates in Sri Lanka, and
                Imbulpitiya estate are among the noteworthy Kandyan tea estates.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Nuwara Eliya Tea District</h2>
            <p>The most popular Ceylon tea among connoisseurs and commoners alike is certainly the tea from
                Nuwara Eliya. In fact, Nuwara Eliya tea is distinct due to its golden hue and fragrant flavor.
                Further, the delicately fragrant Nuwara Eliya tea is the palest among Ceylon teas.
                Moreover, Nuwara Eliya boasts a unique climate with moderate rains, chilly days, and frosty
                nights. It is more mountainous than any other part of the island and belongs to the highest of
                high-grown regions.The history of some of the premier tea factories in Nuwara Eliya runs back
                more than 100 years.
                However, a visit to Nuwara Eliya won’t be complete without a walk through the tea trails of Sri
                Lanka.</p>

            <h2>Dimbula Tea District</h2><br>
            <p class="dim-p">Anyone has the chance to visit the refreshingly mellow tea sprouts in Dimbula, situated between
                Nuwara Eliya and Hortain Plains. Owing to the complex topography in the area, a range of
                microclimates can be experienced in the Dimbula tea district. However, the tea grown here has a
                golden orange hue, a bit darker than tea grown in its neighbor, Nuwara Eliya, but has a
                surprisingly mellow flavor.
                Dimbula was an unspoiled part of the island before the British colonization and was deserted
                until tea cultivation began here in the 1870s. Wet and misty hills flatter the scenery. However,
                the Dimbula tea district comprises the following sub-districts.</p>
            <img src="images/kotagala.jpg" class="pl-sideimage" id="side-img-ol">
            <ol>
                <li>Nanu Oya</li>

                <li>Maskeliya</li>
            </ol><br>
            <p>In addition, Somerset estate, Great western estate, and Queensbury estate are some of Dimbula tea
                estates with significance.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Uva Tea District</h2><br>
            <p>Uva is the remotest, and the least accessible tea district in Sri Lanka. It has two main parts:
                Badulla, the hilly area, and Monaragala, the dry part. Yet, tea growing is only visible in
                Badulla and its subdistricts, including the famous Ella, Haputale, Idalgashinna, and Welimada.
                Thus, the tea-growing areas in Uva spread in the Southeastern parts of the central hills and
                receive rains from both Northwest and Southwest monsoons.
                The British had not considered growing tea in Uva until the construction of a railway line from
                Colombo to Badulla. However, ‘exquisitely aromatic’ Uva tea is among the most sought-after
                Ceylon tea at present. Medium-bodied Uva tea is strong and has darker tones with rosy hues. As
                Uva’s elevation ranges between 1000m to 1500m, it belongs to the high-grown tea region.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Dambatenne Estate</h2><br>
            <p>With a major tourist attraction, Lipton’s seat, and ever-flourishing tea cultivation stretching
                up to as far as the eye can capture, the Dambatenne estate in Haputale remains a significant
                attraction. As per the records, the owner of the tea estate was a Scotsman, Thomas Lipton. He
                persuaded the coffee-loving American nation to drink tea from his own estate, the finest, no
                doubt.
                Thus, at the topmost of the estate is a statue of Thomas Lipton with a teacup in his hands
                probably admiring the breathtaking panorama view. Besides, Halpewatte tea factory, Madulsima
                plantations, Caravanella plantations, and Demodara plantations are some tea destinations worth
                visiting in the Uva tea district.</p>

            <h2>Uda Pussellewa Tea District</h2><br>
            <p>The least popular of Ceylon tea, but not with the least prize is Uda Pusselewa tea. Due to its
                proximity to Nuwara Eliya, it is often compared with tea from Nuwara Eliya, but the liquor is
                darker and strong compared to the latter. “Exquisitely tangy” is the expert’s remark on Uda
                Pussellwa tea
                Located between the tea districts of Kandy and Uva, Uda Pussellewa is the smallest tea district
                of the seven. It is a less densely populated area, and thus, most of the land is covered with
                tea. Ragala, Maturara, and Halgranoya are the main sub-districts of the region. Uda Pussellwe
                belongs to the high-grown region with an altitude ranging from 900m to 1600m. Further, the land
                with no tea belongs to the Hakgala strict forest reserve. Besides, the Uda Pussellewa receives
                rain from both Southwest monsoons and Northeast Monsoons and therefore enjoys two quality
                seasons.
                Uda Pussellwa was also a pristine region before tea plantations and even today rare flora and
                fauna can be encountered. Leopards frequent the forests and are occasionally visible in tea
                plantations as well.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Ruhuna Tea District</h2><br>
            <p>Classified as low-grown tea, Ruhuna tea is grown on the southern end of the central massif.
                Full-flavored black tea produced in Ruhuna is “distinctively unique” as attested by the
                connoisseurs. In 1900, tea cultivation began in Ruhuna, much later than other tea districts. The
                British opened the first tea estates on the outskirts of Sinharaja reserve in the vicinity of
                the Galle and Matara railways. Galle, Matara, and Deniyaya are the main sub-districts of Ruhuna.

            <p>While the tea industry was mainly under the control of the British, the Ruhuna tea industry was
                the first to come under the Ceylonese planting fraternity. Tea bushes grow rapidly in the low
                elevation estates of Ruhuna producing a long tea leaf. It’s similar to the neighboring
                Sabaragamuwa tea but Ruhuna tea has a stronger aroma.
                With an elevation below 600m, Devtura estate, Moragolla estate, and New Deniyaya estate are among
                the leading tea producers of the region. Along with its nearby resident, Sabaragamuwa, Ruhuna
                tea has distinct claims to a substantive 60% of Ceylon tea production.</p>
